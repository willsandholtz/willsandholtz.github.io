[**Group Incentive Compatibility in a Market with Indivisible Goods: A Comment**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176524004221) (with Andrew Tai)
*Economics Letters*, October 2024  
[PDF](SandholtzTai24_economicsletters.pdf) [Click for abstract](#abstract1)  
  - Highlighted in [Al Roth's blog post](https://marketdesigner.blogspot.com/2024/09/a-40-year-old-proof-about-top-trading.html)

<div id="abstract1" style="display: none; text-align: justify;">
We note that the proofs of Bird (1984), the first to show group strategy-proofness of top trading cycles (TTC), require correction. We provide a counterexample to a critical claim and present corrected proofs in the spirit of the originals. We also present a novel proof of strong group strategy-proofness using the corrected results.

**House-Swapping with Objective Indifferences** (with Andrew Tai)
[PDF](SandholtzTai_house_swapping.pdf) [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/house-swapping) [Click for abstract](#abstract2)  

<div id="abstract2" style="display: none; text-align: justify;">
We propose a novel mechanism for house-swapping where agents can express objective indifferences between houses. The mechanism ensures stability and fairness under these conditions.
